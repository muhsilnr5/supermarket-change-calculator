# supermarket-change-calculator
My first project
ðŸ›’ Supermarket Change Calculator (C Language)
A simple and practical C program built to solve a real-world issue I noticed at my local supermarket. Every month, newly hired accountants often get nervous or confused when calculating the change to give customers after a purchase.

This project automates the process by:

ðŸ’° Accepting input for item cost and amount paid

ðŸ§® Calculating total change to return

ðŸ”„ Breaking it down into quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies for faster, stress-free change distribution

Perfect for quick use at point-of-sale or as a beginner-friendly coding exercise.
